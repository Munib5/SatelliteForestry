# Detecting Forest Types using Satellite Data
Curbing climate change by active monitoring

This project attempts to use satellite spectral imaging to identify different forest ecosystems and thereby note down their change over time. This becomes increasingly important when we take into account that more arid environments have a higher proportions of cactus-like ecosystems, and more humid have more tropic forestry. Identifying the progression of each forest ecosystem in a specific region helps us understand what environmental factors are more prevalent and therefore how the environment in the region changed. It can enable us to predict and detect the spread of aridity or humidity and gather more information on the negative effects of climate change. A great example of this method is in the figure below:
